      <p>
        Aspiring Software Developer with a Passion for Coding and Motorcycling and a Love for Technology and Gaming. I’m an enthusiastic software developer with a solid foundation in web development and IT support, backed by a diverse professional background.<br><br> I am currently enrolled in the 9-week long intensive Web Development bootcamp with Le Wagon Tokyo, where I sharpen my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES6, SQL, and Ruby on Rails. I learn how to design, implement, and ship production-ready projects while collaborating with my fellow bootcamp students on many challenges. As an IT Analyst at HCL, I provided seamless operational support for Volvo’s Dutch and Belgian branches and managed account security and accessibility. My experience also includes advanced data tracking and analytics at Cognizant, where I specialized in Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics, and e-commerce tagging, giving me a solid grasp of data-driven development and customer insight tools.<br><br> Beyond coding, I’m an avid motorcyclist and stay tuned into the latest game development and technology news. This passion for technology and gaming fuels my creativity and keeps me on the cutting edge of tech trends.
